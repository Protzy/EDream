### EDream

---

The EDream learning system is an application that educates and connects people based on common interests, aiming to assist users in making smart decisions and turning everyday commute into fulfilling journeys.

Commuting time is often spent simply waiting to arrive at the destination, leading to an unfulfilling feeling. There is a need for a simple solution to fill this time gap. Our system will automatically create lesson plans and deliver them to the user to be completed at their convenience. 

This system will benefit commuters, giving them the opportunity to explore their varying interests. Our goal is to maximize productivity during downtime to create and bolster communities based around non-career-pursued interests. 

Our product is not stand-alone, as it pulls from pre-existing resources such as online video sites and encyclopedias. The strength of our product comes from the lesson paths, quizzes, and content structure that it contains based on these resources.
